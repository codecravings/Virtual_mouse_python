# Virtual_mouse_python

Read these instructions to avoid errors...

1) Python version should be 3.7 as you will get errors while installing cv2
2) Install the modules named as cv2,cvzone,mouse and numpy.
3) Code opens but doesn't work try replacing line no. 10 with cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
4) If you still get the error it's probably because you don't have web cam just buy one :)
